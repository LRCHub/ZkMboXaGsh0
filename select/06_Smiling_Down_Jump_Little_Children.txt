Saturday night I was making my way
I was making my way back home
Walking on the broken bottles
Swinging from the streetlights,
Swinging home
And I was walking along with a spring in m-why bended kn-ee
Walking on a leather sidewalk
Feeling like a cow-boy
Riding on
And the moon
And the moon.....is smiling down
A tip of the hat and a square of the chin
To the corner milky whites
Walking on a city streetlight
Grazing on the as-phalt
Hanging out
A burning machine like a red hot iron wagon wheel
A wild horse in the city traffic
Screaming out "car crash" in my ear
Ohh, Oh, Oh (3x's)
Oh, Oh, Oh, Ohhh
Broken glass from the tin can candy
The tin can candy red
Blue smoke and cold sweat shower
Screaming out "si-lence" in the crowd
And nobody moves cause nobody ca-an
Stand back on the city corner
Everbodys wondering if they're dead
A hollering whoop from a redhead ambulance
Take off like a magic carpet
Rub the red lantern and make a wish
....and the moon.
Ohh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Ohhh
