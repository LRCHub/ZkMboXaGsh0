Now, there's something else that is said after a death, but this one involves belief, which is where I begin to have big problems.
This one happens after the funeral, after the burial, back at the house.
Back at the house where the family and friends and the loved ones of the deceased are having some food and drink, and they're enjoying some warm reminiscences of the person who passed away, sooner or later, someone is bound to say the following, especially after a few drinks.
You know, I think he's up there now smiling down at us, and I think he's pleased.
Now, first of all, there is no up there no, no for people to be smiling down from.
It's poetic.
It's quaint.
And I guess for superstitious people, it provides a little comfort, but it doesn't exist.
But if it did, if it did, and if someone did somehow survive death in a non-physical form, I personally think he'd be far too busy with other celestial activities than to be standing around paradise smiling down on live people.
What kind of fucking eternity is that?
And why is it no one ever says, I think he's down there now, smiling up at us.
Apparently, it never occurs to people that their loved ones might be in hell.
